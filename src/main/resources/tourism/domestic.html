            <p>Against a backdrop of the cerulean waters of the Bay of Bengal, Andaman Islands sparkle like emerald jewels, thanks to the lush green tropical foliage. Adorned with long stretches of silvery beaches, these islands are a popular destination for a vacation in the middle of nowhere. Most of these islands are a part of the union territory of India and are home to the only Palaeolithic people in the world. Out of the 300 odd islands comprising the Andaman archipelago, only a few are open to tourists. Havelock Island is the most popular and has the most beautiful beach in Asia, called Radha Nagar Beach. The vision of the blazing red sun sinking beneath the waves, from this beach, is indeed a sight to behold. Ross Island is a paradise for history enthusiasts with its ruins from the time of the British rule. Port Blair, the administrative center of Andaman Islands, is a mixture of modern amenities and old world charm. The Cellular Jail is a testament to the trials of the freedom fighters of India, who were once imprisoned here. Dive into the clear waters enveloping Andaman and lose yourself in an enchanting underwater world, filled with colorful coral reefs. The Andaman Islands in India is an experience like no other! </p>

      <p>At first glance, the city of Delhi, home to 16 million people, seems full of mayhem. But underneath this chaotic tapestry lies a magic that is unique to the capital city of India. Known as ‘Indraprasth’ of old, the city has seen the rise and fall of many empires over the centuries. A succession of conquerors has left their mark on Delhi, especially the Mughals, who patronized this city and made it their own. The modern city of Delhi is a blend of medieval forts, beautiful mausoleums, colonial-era buildings, colorful bazaars and technological sophistication. It is the second most populous city in India and is a quintessential melting pot of a medley of cultures and traditions. The Jama Masjid, Qutub Minar, India Gate, Lotus Temple, Red Fort and Raj Ghat are a few of the must-see attractions in Delhi. New Delhi is the seat of power of the Indian Government. Witness the grandeur of Parliament House, Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Supreme Court of India. A trip to Delhi is incomplete without a taste of its unique cuisine, which is best experienced from the street-side vendors of chaats, pav bhajis, and masala tea. </p>
