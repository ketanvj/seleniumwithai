# Copilot Custom Instructions: Utilities

- Place all utility/helper classes in the `src/main/java/com/nichethyself/utilities/` directory (e.g., WebDriver utilities, data providers, config readers).
- Utilities should be generic and reusable across tests and page objects.
- Do not include test logic or page-specific code here.
- Example file names: `TestDataUtil.java`, `ConfigReader.java`, `WaitUtils.java`.
- Document utility methods for clarity and maintainability.
